//initially give option to the user to Create new flashcards or use exiting ones.

//If the choice is to create a card then ask what type 'basic or cloze'

		// run a createCard function that runs a BasicCard Constructor or ClozeCard constructor based on the users answer.

			// **Basic Card Constructor -- ask the user for there question and then ask for an answer. Store the responses in 
			//   a JSON object to pull from later

			// **Cloze Card Constuctor -- ask the user for the full text of their card. Then ask for the cloze portion they
			//   want to replace with '...'

			// After a card is created ask the user if they would like to make another card (recall createCard Function), use the
			// card (call the askQuestions function), or exit the application back to the command prompt.

//if the answer is 'Use' then run an askQuestions function

			// pull the stored cards from the stored JSON and present them to the user. use a function that uses a counter to loop 
			// through the questions using recursion.

			//after each question print if the user is correct, if not print the correct answer.
